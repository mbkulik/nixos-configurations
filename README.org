* NixOS setup

My goal is to reproduce my current fedora setup in NixOS without using home-manager or flakes.
Then slowly integrate more advanced nix features.

** Steps

1. reproduce base OS using nix
   - dot file managed using git/stow like I am doing it now
   - UI customization using settings/gnome tweaks
2. Use home-manager for setting dconf settings
3. Use home-manager to replace dot management via git/stow?
